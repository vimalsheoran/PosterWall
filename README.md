# Readme For Contributors #
Hi thanks for going through this documentation
What is PosterWall ? Good question. PosterWall is a way that various campus chapters and   return
societies can publish their events digitally. This web application aids in creating event posts  return
and then, these posts can be published through the PosterWall mobile app for students to   return
view.

### Getting Started ###
The Server side script for these application is written in Python using the Flask framework.
There is still a lot of work to do on the front-end as far as the UI and templating is   
considered. At this moment, only HTML and CSS codes are accepted for commits. Please do not
make any contributions to server side  code.

### Requirements ###
* flask         -- pip install flask
* flask_mysqldb -- pip install flask_mysqldb
* wtforms       -- pip install wtforms
* passlib.hash  -- pip install passlib (Not being used in the initial commit)
* functools     -- pip install functools
* flask_wtf     -- pip install flask_wtf (Not being used)

I have installed all the dependencies using a virtual environment. Once all the required modules are
use 'python app.py' to trigger the server.

### Few Things ###
* Designed specifically for University of Petroleum and Energy Studies, however, can be redesigned for other
colleges as well. Contact me if that is the case.

* Only UI commits will be accepted at this moment.

* Follow the directory tree as given or else bad things might happen.

* Mail me if you are contributing and come accross any problem.
